# ELSA Localization Pipeline

The NYC Mayorâ€™s Office of the CTO (MOCTO) is developing an open-source translation pipeline that aims to streamline the process of translation management for itself and potentially other city agencies. 

- **Open-source:** We are committed to making our entire platform publicly accessible. 
- **Easy setup:** Our service should be easy to understand and set up. 
- **Modular:** The separate components of our pipeline should be easily adaptable. We hope to eventually expand our integrations with more version control systems and translation service plugins. 

**Please reach out to [jiman@cto.nyc.gov](mailto:jiman@cto.nyc.gov) if you would like to get involved!**
