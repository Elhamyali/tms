# Open-Source Translation Pipeline

This project is an open-source translation pipeline that aims to streamline the process of translation management. It is maintained by the NYC Mayor's Office of the CTO. 

- **Open-source:** We are committed to making our entire platform publicly accessible. 
- **Easy setup:** Our service should be easy to understand and set up. 
- **Modular:** The separate components of our pipeline should be easily adaptable. We hope to eventually expand our integrations with more version control systems and translation service plugins. 

**Please see our [onboarding document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dFMEN6JwqkAfVwkoQaYkzCT--Hp4zvCJ7ucyMOfsHwQ/edit?usp=sharing) if you would like to get involved!**
