# ELSA Localization Pipeline

The NYC Mayorâ€™s Office of the CTO (MOCTO) is developing an open-source translation pipeline that aims to streamline the process of translation management for itself and potentially other city agencies. 

- **Open-source:** We are committed to making our entire platform publicly accessible. 
- **Easy setup:** Our service should be easy to understand and set up. 
- **Modular:** The separate components of our pipeline should be easily adaptable. We hope to eventually expand our integrations with more version control systems and translation service plugins. 

For a high-level overview of the pipeline, please see our [presentation slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HAfbpOXG-ksyBjDpF-ZmOaoArvrinVd6iLmhdn6lkg0/edit?usp=sharing) and our [SOW document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f-yilhmdHt9QExUmCB8G0mV59lEBbVFY1pYvWkvJUbU/edit?usp=sharing).
