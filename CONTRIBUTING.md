# How to Contribute

We're so glad you're here! ELSA would not exist without the support of the open-source community, and we want to make it as easy as possible to help out and revolutionize the way in which government agencies handle localization. As we are still in the early stages of setting up our pipeline, please reach out to [jiman@cto.nyc.gov](mailto:jiman@cto.nyc.gov) if you would like to get involved!

## Getting Started

  - Our work currently lives on an Amazon EC2 instance. Please ask Justin for access to this server. 
  - Take the opportunity to read the onboarding document and look around the server. 
  - If you would like to set up the pipeline on your local machine, follow the setup instructions. 

> But I'm not a coder, I'm just interested in setting up a translation pipeline for my organization! 

We aim to make our pipeline as easy to set up as possible, and modular enough to fit the needs of your organization. If you are interested in our service, please email [jiman@cto.nyc.gov](mailto:jiman@cto.nyc.gov)!
